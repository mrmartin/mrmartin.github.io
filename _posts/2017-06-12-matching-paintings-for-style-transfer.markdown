Style transfer using deep neural networks does the following: you select a photo, a painting, and the style of the painting is transferred into the photo. Unfortunately, this usually doesn't work very well, producing unintented and unexpected results.

I thought it would be interesting to automatically find paintings for a give photo. If the subject matter is similar, perhaps style transfer could work well. [Here is what I did](http://www.fit.vutbr.cz/~kolarmartin/mine/style.html)

[And here are the results!](http://www.fit.vutbr.cz/~kolarmartin/mine/full_table.html)

Depending on your expectations, you may agree that most of the results also aren't great. It will be interesting to explore this topic further.

edit: I've set up my online photo albums on google photos. No cost, no limit, smart browsing. [Like this](https://goo.gl/photos/nMcuK4KZWNzJrHWs6)
