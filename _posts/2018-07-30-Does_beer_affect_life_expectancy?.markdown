Is beer bad for you? A question often discussed in pubs, bars, restaurants, and caf√©s, but without sobering results.

Data Science to the rescue! There is enormous variation between the average per-capita beer consumption among countries of the world, so let's see if there is correlation between beer consumption and life expectancy.

Both source of data are simply Wikipiedia tables<sup>[1](#beer)</sup><sup>[2](#age)</sup>

By formatting the data to a simple csv table, it can be loaded into Matlab, and visualised with the following code:

```matlab
fid=fopen('Desktop/beer consumption and life expectancy.csv')
out=textscan(fid,'%s%f%f','delimiter',',')
beer = out{2}
age = out{3}
scatter(beer,age)
text(beer+dx, age+dy, out{1})
title('Beer consumption vs Life expectancy per Country')
xlabel('liters of beer per capita per year')
ylabel('life expectancy for both genders')
```

And this is what we get:

![Beer Consumption vs Life Expectancy]({{ site.url }}/images/beer_vs_age.png)

No clear correlation, right? That's easy to quantify with `[p, r]=corrcoef(beer,age)`. This data gives us a correlation of `0.2129`, which means 'not much correlation'. In fact, the p-value is `0.1086`, meaning 'not significant'.
