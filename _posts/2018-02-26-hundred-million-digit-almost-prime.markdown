After 4761 hours of computation, I proved that 2<sup>382242031</sup>-1 is not a prime. 

There is an ongoing search for large primes, with a prize awarded to the discovery of the first prime of one hundred million digits. So I got busy, and performed the Lucas-Lehmer primality test on my powerful GPU.

Better luck next time!
