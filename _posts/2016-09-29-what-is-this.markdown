In order to host my website, I've tried a number of different technologies over the years. Free webhost, free VPS, then a paid VPS, and finally my own Cubieboard at home. Now I'm trying github.io hosting, and I'm very excited about it.

In an hour or so, a relatively experience github user can set this up. Here's what I did:

- set up mrmartin.github.io
- configure the mrmartin.github.io repository to accept the mrmartin.net domain
- connect my domain host by changing DNS settings A and CNAME
- locally install Jekyll on my Mac
- run, test, and push to github
- write this post to see that it works


For my next trick, I'd like to set up a photo gallery, and edit the about page to contain some personal info, like a list of publications, online references, favourite books and so on.

edit: I've set up my online photo albums on google photos. No cost, no limit, smart browsing. [Like this](https://goo.gl/photos/nMcuK4KZWNzJrHWs6)
