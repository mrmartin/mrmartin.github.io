## An online cooperation community 

Inspired by the pre-commercial success of StackOverflow, github, and reddit, imagine a website that lets people set goals and causes, and achieve them together. The workflow is as follows:

1. Suggest a goal, write a proposal
2. Make a plan
3. Execute the plan
4. Benefit

People can pitch in, suggest edits, and discuss. The system is set up to enable personal development, public initiatives, and a sense of community. The exchange of money is not implicit to the system, but still allowed.

The system could be built from a forum system, or a StackOverflow clone. The important elements will be voting, reputation points, and good will.
