In 1965, Marvin Minsky wrote an interesting essay about the implications of intelligence. I enjoyed the read, but found that the ancient scans were hard to read. 

So I re-worked the original article into latex, and created a more readable version. You'll find it [here](https://github.com/mrmartin/Matter-Mind-and-Models).

Several interesting parallels are drawn, such as our own understanding of intelligence only being attributed to systems which we do not understand. A recommended read for anyone working in Machine Learning or interested in Artificial Intelligence.
