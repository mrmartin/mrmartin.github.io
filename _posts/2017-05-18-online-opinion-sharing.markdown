People are interested in other people's opinions, and they like to share their views. This is important on all levels of society, be it while interacting with friends, or while planning international relations.

There are various platforms allowing the sharing of such information, but all of them contain a lot of clutter: they do not specialize.

Today, I created [opinion](http://opinion.000webhostapp.com), a simple platform to share opinions. It's very simple, and a lot could be done to make it more attractive. But it works.

Once enough data is gathered here, I'll do some analysis and prediction to do clever stuff.
